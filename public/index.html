                    Rules: The goal is to play nine holes of golf with the least amount of strokes possible. 
                    The ball will move towards wherever the mouse is so the farther away the mouse is the harder it will be hit. 
                    To hit the ball, click the mouse. 
                    Each mouseclick is a stroke however so try and keep it as low as possible. 
                    The course is randomly generated so you could have a really hard hole, or a really easy one.
                    Avoid the lava at all cost because it will put the ball back at the start.
                    You can hit the ball again while its still moving, but remember each click is a stroke.
                    Good luck to all!
